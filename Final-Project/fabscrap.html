         <h2 class="project-subtitle  reveal"> Project Overview<hr></h2>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Overview </h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">The decision to redesign both FABSCRAP's brand and website came from a mix of passion for sustainable living and the untapped potential and opportunities we spotted in the initial user interface assessment. You know, the kind of stuff that keeps us UX/UI designers on our toes. We didn't just want to fix things – we wanted to make them better, and doing it for a non-profit that is changing the game in the world of textile recycling was just the cherry on top. <br> <br>
                During our initial research on FABSCRAP, we uncovered that their unique approach to tackling textile waste in fashion and entertainment hotspots like NYC and Philly struck a chord with us. They collect smaller amounts of textiles and fabrics making it easier for the “smaller shops” to recycle their waste sustainably - they were doing their part and doing it on a smaller scale while thinking of a bigger one. This dedication and effort they showed towards textile recycling was a cause we could get behind as all our group members shared a passion for living more sustainably. As we dug deeper into the company, we found out they're not just talking the talk but walking the walk, with ongoing success and a real impact.<br> <br> This only fuelled our motivation to transform the website into a hub for textile recyclers and textile recycling information, making it easily accessible for other users to become involved and more aware of this remarkable company and its mission. </p>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Our Goal</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">Over the course of three weeks, our team undertook the redesign of the FABSCRAP website with the primary objective of elevating user experience and modernizing the user interface to mirror the organization's growing accomplishments. The central goal was to make what they do and how the average person could get involved extremely clear to any user. The new UI design and branding was designed in mind with the idea of establishing FABSCRAP as a prominent creative sustainability hub for designers, makers, and leaders in textile sustainability. </p>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">Our team of UX/UI designers successfully transformed FABSCRAP's website, achieving a user-friendly platform that effectively communicates the organization's mission and encourages engagement in textile recycling. Through a comprehensive rebranding and restructuring process, we simplified the user journey and enhanced information clarity, proven by the positive responses in the rigorous user tests that ensured optimal user experience.
                <br><br>
                Post-completion, we reached out to FABSCRAP's CEO, Jessica Schreiber, through persistent email and LinkedIn messages. Our persistence paid off when we received a positive response!
                
                The CEO's enthusiasm for our design concepts has paved the way for a collaboration, with our team now actively involved in the website development phase. This collaboration stands as a testament to our commitment to delivering not just a website but an impactful digital experience that aligns seamlessly with FABSCRAP's mission and vision.</p>

            <p class="project-text  reveal">By conducting a Heuristic Analysis on the website and conducting 5 initial user interviews, we concluded that the main issues the FABSCRAP website currently faces is usability challenges, and a lack of clarity in its user interface and information architecture. <br><br>

                Users struggled to comprehend the organization's mission and impact. Users also faced difficulty finding ways to get involved. In addition, the current website didn’t highlight what makes FABSCRAP unique in textile recycling, causing users to wonder why they are so successful. Enhancing these aspects is crucial not only for building a better website but also for fostering growth in their business by effectively conveying their mission. </p>

                In the process of developing sketches and a low-fidelity prototype, I began by conducting a thorough analysis of the current website's information architecture. Utilizing insights gained from a card sorting activity and user test data, I identified existing issues and defined clear objectives for the redesign, focusing on improving navigation, user comprehension of FABSCRAP's mission, and pathways for user engagement. The sketching phase involved creating rough paper sketches to explore different layout options and information hierarchies, prioritizing key elements based on user insights. Subsequently, these sketches were translated into a low-fidelity prototype using design tools, maintaining simplicity to focus on core structure and layout.</p>

            <p class="project-text  reveal">
                Building on user feedback from the low-fidelity prototype, our mid-fidelity objectives focused on fixing navigation issues. We introduced new elements while testing out our UI style guide, including color scheme tests for better visual aesthetics. This integration ensured a cohesive design, enhancing the user experience and maintaining brand consistency. Subsequent testing showed fewer concerns about site architecture, however, increased attention & issues were raised on refining specific design elements.</p>

        <p class="project-text  reveal">
            To create the high-fidelity version, I built upon the insights gathered from the mid-fidelity phase. The primary focus remained on addressing any remaining usability issues and fine-tuning design elements. I implemented the finalized design based on the feedback received during the mid-fidelity testing, ensuring that the navigation was seamless, and design elements were visually appealing.
In the process of creating the high-fidelity version, I adopted an iterative approach by developing multiple versions. Each version incorporated slight variations in design, color schemes, and layout choices. This allowed for a comprehensive exploration of different design possibilities.
Subsequently, I conducted user testing on each of these multiple versions. This involved gathering feedback on the overall user experience, visual aesthetics, and any potential issues or preferences users might have had. By employing this iterative testing process, I aimed to identify the most effective design elements and address any remaining concerns.</p>
