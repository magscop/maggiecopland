         <h2 class="project-subtitle  reveal"> Project Overview<hr></h2>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Overview</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">The idea for this mobile app design project came to me while waiting in the entry line before a concert. It was a concert that featured my favourite artist, and one that I purchased tickets 6 months in advance too. Needless to say, while waiting in line I was excited, however, the excitement quickly turned into stress at the venue's entrance as I struggled to find the tickets in all the different apps and email accounts I had on my phone. This stressful concert experience led me to propose a solution to my group members the very next day – a simple app to ease the process of accessing event tickets that would be more user-friendly than all the third-party ticketing apps currently out there. When I shared the concept, they all related to similar struggles, confirming the widespread need for a straightforward solution to streamline ticket management for concert-goers. <br> <br> The decision to integrate within the Spotify app came later, as we realized the platform's crucial role in users' music and event experiences. This shift allowed us to integrate the ticket-saving feature directly into the Spotify app, aligning the project more closely with users' habits and preferences.</p>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Our Goal</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">
                The primary goal of the project was to develop a user-friendly mobile application that simplified the process of accessing and managing event tickets, particularly for concert-goers. The aim was to eliminate the stress and inconvenience associated with searching through various apps and emails for tickets, providing users with a seamless and centralized solution. Additionally, the project sought to enhance the overall concert-going experience by integrating the ticket-saving feature directly into the Spotify app, aligning with users' preferences and habits. The ultimate objective was to contribute to user satisfaction, retention, and potentially enhance Spotify subscriptions, creating a comprehensive and compelling solution for both music and event needs.</p>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">Our successful integration of the ticket-saving feature into Spotify was guided by insights gathered through user interviews and testing. The high-fidelity prototype, shaped by user feedback, offered an intuitive and user-friendly solution providing a seamless solution for uploading and accessing tickets at any time.
<br> <br>
                By recognizing the significance of Spotify in the concert-goers' experience, our addition to the app addressed specific pain points, contributing to an improved user journey for Spotify's users. This collaboration not only enhanced our applications functionality but also played a pivotal role in refining the broader user experience within the Spotify ecosystem.</p>

            <p class="project-text  reveal">Through six focused twenty-minute Zoom interviews, we gathered qualitative insights by engaging users with targeted questions, eliciting real-time feedback and context-driven responses. To broaden our understanding, we deployed a Google Forms survey, crafted with key questions from interviews, allowing for feedback from a larger user pool.

                This dual-method approach facilitated a comprehensive view, enabling us to triangulate data for robust analysis. The combined insights from intimate interviews and broader surveys played a pivotal role in refining our product, ensuring it aligns with user experiences and preferences for a user-friendly end result. </p>

                Upon reviewing the feedback of our user interviews, it became obvious that the problem we were trying to solve was evident in everyone’s lives. 
                Almost all users stated that they have struggled to find their tickets before an event causing them so much stress it negatively affected their concert experience. 
                ​<br>
                <br>
                Other key insights:
                <br>
                1. Users genuinely like Spotify’s interface, user capabilities and user-friendly systems. 
                <br>
                2. Users purchase concert tickets months in advance and commonly lose track of their tickets in their email or camera roll.
                <br>
                3. Users commonly use Spotify to prepare for concerts and revisit to listen to music afterward.
                <br>
                4. Users like to use Apple Wallet but not every ticket can go into Apple Wallet.
                <br>
                5. Users like that when you are logged into Spotify on any device you stay logged in. </p>

This helps maintain brand coherence and a sense of familiarity. The introduction of different shades of purple is a strategic move to highlight the new feature, providing a visual cue that sets it apart from the rest of the interface. These new shades of purple were tested and achieved an AA accessibility rating.</p>

            <p class="project-text  reveal">
                Building on user feedback from the low-fidelity prototype, our mid-fidelity objectives focused on design & navigation issues. We introduced new elements while testing out our UI style guide, including UI elements for better visual aesthetics. This integration ensured a cohesive design, enhancing the user experience and maintaining brand consistency with Spotify’s UI. Subsequent testing showed fewer concerns about the user journey of uploading a ticket, however, increased attention & issues were raised on refining specific design elements specifically with people wanting it to match Spotify’s aesthetic more. </p>

        <p class="project-text  reveal">
            To design the high-fidelity version, I built upon the insights gathered from the mid-fidelity & low-fidelity phases. The main issues identified were the overall design and how it integrated into Spotify’s interface.  By undergoing iterative processes, we honed the design to align seamlessly with Spotify's interface, instilling a sense of authenticity that made users perceive the feature as an integral part of the app. The main challenge was designing for the dark mode that Spotify’s UI app presented in, and selecting colour and UI elements that helped it stand out as a “new feature”.</p>
