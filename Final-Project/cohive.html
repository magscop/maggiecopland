         <h2 class="project-subtitle  reveal"> Project Overview<hr></h2>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Overview </h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal"> As a graduate from OCAD University (BDes) and the University of Toronto's UX/UI BootCamp, I witnessed firsthand the struggles of individuals transitioning from academia to the professional realm within the creative sector. Conversations with peers revealed a common sentiment: despite talent and passion, many creatives lacked opportunities to showcase their skills effectively. The idea for CoHive stemmed from trying to create both a solution and opportunities for young creatives to professionally develop and ultimately land full-time jobs. 
<br><br>
                Further research into the challenges faced by creatives entering the workforce revealed that traditional resumes and portfolios, while important for securing employment, often do not fully demonstrate the range of a creative individual's abilities. This gap was worsened by market saturation, limited collaboration opportunities, and the difficulties of interdisciplinary work. It became clear that creatives needed more than just a display of past projects; they required a dynamic platform that would facilitate connection, collaboration, and growth among peers to build a comprehensive and collaborative portfolio that would help them land a job. 
                <br><br>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> The Goal</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">Over the course of two weeks, my primary objective for CoHive was to develop a platform that would help creatives professionally develop and ultimately land a job. The overarching vision was to construct a unified ecosystem serving as a comprehensive platform where users could forge new connections, collaborate cross-disciplinarily, and effectively manage and oversee their own projects while ensuring safe and secure communication within one single application.</p>
            <h3 class="project-subtitle-2  reveal"> Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="project-text  reveal">
                In conclusion, the high-fidelity prototype developed for CoHive effectively demonstrates the essential features envisioned for the platform. Despite the time constraints of just two weeks, the prototype showcases dedication and vision toward addressing the challenges young creatives face when transitioning into the professional realm.
                
                While there was a desire to delve deeper into the app's development, the prototype serves as a strong foundation for future iterations. Looking ahead, CoHive holds great promise in fostering a unified ecosystem that emphasizes connection, collaboration, and growth. It stands poised to make a meaningful impact on the creative sector, opening doors to new opportunities and advancements for aspiring professionals.

            The design and features of the app were developed systematically. A storyboard helped establish the lead up to downloading the app and the value proposition chart helped prioritize features based on user needs. Then, sketches were created for each screen, refining them based on usability principles and feedback. This method ensured an intuitive and effective user experience.</p>

                To guide UI development, I curated a mood board and brand personality chart for CoHive. The mood board embodied a modern, inviting, and edgy design ethos, while the brand personality chart highlighted traits such as innovation, supportiveness, progressiveness, and authenticity, shaping the visual and conceptual foundations of the brand.</p>

            <p class="project-text  reveal">
                Six user tests were performed on both low-fidelity and mid-fidelity prototypes, in conjunction with four heat maps of key content screens. This process yielded deeper insights into the app's usability. Feedback primarily centred on the overall design of the application, with users also expressing a desire for greater functionality expansion.</p>

        <p class="project-text  reveal">
            The design of the mid-fidelity prototype evolved through iterative processes following user tests conducted on tasks such as onboarding, profile creation, project posting, and home feed exploration. Subsequent to these tests and further exploration of the app's features, the UI style tile was utilized to guide the prototype's design. Additional iterations were made based on findings from user testing and continued exploration of the app's functionalities.</p>

        <p class="project-text  reveal">
            In tailoring the high-fidelity redesign to Cohive users, we conducted targeted user research and collected feedback to understand their needs. We simplified complex features based on user frustrations and prioritized enhancements like real-time collaboration tools, guided by user input. Through iterative design and active user involvement, we created a final product that aligns closely with Cohive users' expectations, delivering a tailored and intuitive experience.</p>
